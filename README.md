# Linux Shell Scripts (Beginner Practice)

This project contains simple shell scripts I wrote to practice basic Linux system tasks using Bash.

## Scripts Included:
- `disk_usage.sh`: Checks if disk usage is above 80%
- `system_info.sh`: Prints hostname, uptime, and user info
- `check_user.sh`: Checks if a Linux user exists on the system

These are part of my learning journey in Linux system administration and scripting.
